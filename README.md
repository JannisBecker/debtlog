This is a well working solution for logging and keeping track of all the debts between
all members living in our apartment. Aside from that, I also used this project to learn about
the HTML5 canvas component using the jCanvas library, and I realized a very adaptable and flexible
solution to show all total debts in a very efficient and intuitive manner. (Look at the /res/js/debtGraph.js file for the code)
